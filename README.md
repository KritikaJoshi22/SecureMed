SecureMed is a blockchain enabled system that will keep the medical history of patients ina chain that is secure and cannot be accessed without their consent.

ML models will work on medical records and help patients achieve healthier lifestyles by suggesting lifestyle changes they can adopt.  

Patients will be given the option to sell their data to corporations doing research or clinical trials by converting it into NFTs(The patientâ€™s data is usually shared with third-party organizations without their consent and without any involvement in the profits generated from its use). The process will be anonymous.
